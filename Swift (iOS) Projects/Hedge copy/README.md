Mission:
To facilitate the creation of mutual funds among millenials and friends to promote financial literacy within the intimidating space of investing.

Preparation:
Install Xcode 9
Clone or download repository
Install CocoaPods (explained here: https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html)
In Terminal and within the cloned repository, run the command "pod install" to install the necessary dependencies
Build and Run:
Open fundu.xcworkspace
Choose your desired device to build on, I recommend iPhone 11
Select the 'Build' button within Xcode to build the project. This will take a few minutes, but a simulator window will display the application on the device chosen in step 2
Simply hit login, as the login feature is currently stubbed
