# Adam's iOS Projects

I taught myself iOS because I love the shippability and tangibility of the iOS process--one week you can have an idea, and the 
next week you can have that project on your phone.

Swift has quickly become my favorite language to work on, and TroJams and RecipMe are both complete iOS projects that I build 
from start to finish, front-end and back-end. Movieviwer and Tipper were both quick side projects while teaching myself iOS development.

I have also worked in Objecive-C, however I am much more proficient in Swift and have built my two extensive projects, RecipMe and TroJams, entirely in Swift.
