Team 35 - Ruth Libowsky, Clairisse Haines, Adam Moffit, Hunter Hurja, Catherine Chung

What works:
	- Login window - can login with username/password, if incorrect an error label shows
	- Create account functionalities - can set first/last name/username/password and optional picture
	- Can create a party
	- Add song names to the song queue


What doesn't:
	- Guest functionality does not work
	- Cannot play music yet (we're really close!)
	- Some of the networking is not solidified yet
	
	
Running our code:
	- Our server is hosted locally by one of the team members' computers, so you might not be able
	  to run our program. We will hopefully be able to fix that soon.
